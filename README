HTTP server

depends on:
luasocket: http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/
luafilesystem: https://keplerproject.github.io/luafilesystem/
lua-ext: https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-ext
lua-csv: https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-csv

usage:
make sure your LUA_PATH points to the directory containing http.lua (and the lua-ext project it depends on) and run:
lua -lhttp

alternatively you can explicitly invoke the file via:
lua path/to/http.lua

to set the port manually (defaults to 8000):
lua -e "port=80" -lhttp

to set the interface manually (defaults to *, which sometimes doesn't work):
lua -e "addr='10.0.0.1'" -lhttp

to use non-blocking clients:
lua -e "block=false" -lhttp

- uses port 8000 by default.
- runs out of the working directory
- provides directory listings
- caches mime types from iana.org into the file ~/.http.lua.conf
