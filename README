HTTP server

depends on:
lua-ext: https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-ext
lua-csv: https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-csv

usage:
make sure your LUA_PATH points to the directory containing http.lua (and the lua-ext project it depends on) and run:
lua -lhttp

alternatively you can explicitly invoke the file via:
lua path/to/http.lua

to set the port manually:
lua -e "port=80" -lhttp

- uses port 8000 by default.
- runs out of the working directory
- provides directory listings
- caches mime types from iana.org into the file ~/.http.lua.conf
